# System Architecture Overview

## Introduction
The QPi-Stablecoin project is designed to provide a secure, stable, and scalable digital currency. The architecture is built on a modular approach, allowing for flexibility and ease of maintenance. This document outlines the key components of the system architecture.

## Key Components

### 1. Smart Contracts
- **QPiToken.sol**: ERC20 token contract that implements the QPi stablecoin.
- **StableValueMechanism.sol**: Manages the dynamic supply adjustment to maintain the stable value of $314.159.
- **Governance.sol**: Facilitates decentralized governance through proposals and voting mechanisms.
- **MultiSigWallet.sol**: Provides enhanced security for fund management through multi-signature functionality.

### 2. Backend Services
- **Transaction Service**: Handles transaction processing, fee estimation, and batching.
- **Governance Service**: Manages proposals, voting, and governance-related logic.
- **Oracle Service**: Fetches external data securely for use in smart contracts.

### 3. Frontend Application
- Built using modern web technologies (e.g., React, Vue.js) to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the QPi ecosystem.

### 4. Quantum Security Layer
- Implements quantum-resistant cryptographic protocols to safeguard user data and transactions against future quantum threats.

## Data Flow
1. Users interact with the frontend application.
2. The frontend communicates with the backend services via RESTful APIs.
3. Backend services interact with the smart contracts deployed on the blockchain.
4. The system ensures secure and efficient processing of transactions and governance actions.

## Conclusion
The architecture of QPi-Stablecoin is designed to be robust, secure, and adaptable to future technological advancements. This modular approach allows for easy updates and integration of new features as the project evolves.
